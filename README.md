# Design Pattern - Bridge Pattern

## Description

![bridge](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-bridge/assets/104809324/d68b2229-1fba-43e6-8131-ef765fd62194)

The Bridge pattern is a design pattern that allows you to expand classes by using a bridge class. You can also use the Bridge pattern when it is:

- Difficult to add classes.
- Necessary to reduce code duplication.

### Class Diagram

The line between the Abstraction class and the Implementor class represents the bridge. The Abstraction class represents the functions, and the Implementor class represents the implementation. If you want to add functions, update the Abstraction class. If you want to add implementations, update the Implementor class.

This app demonstrates how cats and dogs cry in Kanto-style and Kansai-style. The Kanto-style and Kansai-style cries are implemented in the Abstraction class, while the Dog and Cat classes are implemented in the Implementor class. When a button is pressed, the cry is displayed in Japanese.
